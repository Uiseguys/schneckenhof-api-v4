Lastly, you'll need to install the LoopBack 4 CLI toolkit:

```sh
npm i -g @loopback/cli
```

## Tutorial

To follow this tutorial, begin with the
[Create your app scaffolding](http://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/todo-tutorial-scaffolding.html)
section.

Note: the code will automatically create all tables


## Try it out

If you'd like to see the final results of this tutorial as an example
application, follow these steps:

1.  Run the `lb4 example` command to select and clone the todo repository:

    ```sh
    $ lb4 example
    ? What example would you like to clone? (Use arrow keys)
    > todo: Tutorial example on how to build an application with LoopBack 4.
    todo-list: Continuation of the todo example using relations in LoopBack 4.
    hello-world: A simple hello-world Application using LoopBack 4.
    log-extension: An example extension project for LoopBack 4.
    rpc-server: A basic RPC server using a made-up protocol.
    ```

2.  Switch to the directory.

    ```sh
    cd loopback4-example-todo
    ```

3.  Finally, start the application!

    ```sh
    $ npm start

    Server is running at http://127.0.0.1:3000
    ```

Feel free to look around in the application's code to get a feel for how it
works. If you're interested in learning how to build it step-by-step, then
